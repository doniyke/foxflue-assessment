# Foxflue Assessment
>The project is to:

>>Create a Nuxt project (Must be Nuxt 3 Project)

>>Implement the UI (You can only use Tailwind CSS and Nuxt UI)

>>Take the User's GPS coordinates, calculate the distance, and show it under the customer address.

>>When the Inspect button is clicked, a Popup should open. In that popup, let the user click a photo and store it as a Base64 Image string in a variable.

>>Once the image is clicked, a Toast message should be shown. And remember, make it a global component so it can be invoked from anywhere in the application.
